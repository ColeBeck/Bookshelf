> Learning strategy:
> 1. Research - The first step in my learning workflow is dedicated to researching the particular topic to gain a functional understanding
> 2. Reduce - The second step involves reducing the information from the research step down to the minimum needed to understand the topic
> 3. Record - The purpose of the third step is to put the information from the reduce stage into a question form that requires understanding of the topic to answer
> 4. Remind - The final step is to remind yourself of the information learned on a regular basis via a spaced repitition service like Anki
